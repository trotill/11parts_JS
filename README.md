## 11parts JavaScript core 
Framework 11-parts (eleven parts) for the development of complexes and devices based on Linux OS. This repository represents part of the framework written in Javascript.

The repository consists of a backend and a frontend.

The build instructions for the project are not ready, the source codes are presented for informational purposes only. In addition to the instructions, a start-up project is also required, it is not here either, it is not ready.

If you are interested in the project please contact me at:

### Features
- using proprietary technologies
- uses technologies such as Webpack, React, MobX, Electron, NodeJs,
- automatic user interface constructor. The graphical interface can be built automatically according to a given configuration, saving up to 80% of development time.
- semi-automatic user interface builder. Designed to create any interface with some automated element insertion.
- most of the development is already done, because ready-made solutions are used. Ready-made solutions can be found [here](https://11-parts.com/ru/programm_blocks)
- 11-parts GUI is displayed the same in WEB browser, device display, PC in Linux and Windows 7/8/10. No need to start developing an interface from scratch for each OS and board
- 11-parts software supports simultaneous operation of several graphical interfaces (clients), for example, you can run the interface on the board through the display, simultaneously through a WEB browser, simultaneously through MS Windows, and the data will change synchronously everywhere. Those. for example, they changed the parameter through the Windows client - on the board and in the WEB it will change synchronously, the value came from the sensor, this field will change synchronously on all clients
the framework is compatible with ARM platforms (NXP imx6/7/8, allwinner, amlogic, rockchip) and x86 (panel PCs, single board PCs)
- Linux distributions are automatically finalized by the firmware builder to a reliable state, resistant to power off, with support for updates. The initial distribution is usually ArchLinux or Yocto, which are brought to perfection by JavaScript and Bash scripts.
